# **Real-time messaging facility over a computer network**üèÉ

## üí°**Main idea**üí°
Create a software tool for exchanging text messages that works on a local network in peer-to-peer mode.
Each messaging participant (node) is identified by an IP address and an arbitrary name that is specified by the user (via a command line parameter). Names are not required to be unique.
Each node uses UDP to form a list of active nodes (IP addresses and names):
* **once started, the node sends a broadcast packet containing its name to notify other nodes on the network of its connection to the network;**
* **other nodes that receive such a packet establish a TCP connection for messaging with the sender and send their name over it for identification in the chat.**<br>

A new client can join the chat at any time.
Messages are exchanged using TCP in a logically shared space: each node maintains one TCP connection with every other node and sends its messages to all nodes in the network. Disabling a node must be correctly handled by other nodes.

## üîé**How to Install**üîç
* **Clone project to your folder:** `git clone https://github.com/amarjin6/chat-room.git`
* **Check for updates and install all necessary [plugins](https://github.com/amarjin6/P2P-chatRoom/tree/master/requirements)**
* **Run project** 

## üõ†**How to Use**üõ†

### **Run the project in your terminal with different IP's**

    python chat.py [host] [username]
    
### **Establish connection**

Connection established automatically after each member joins chat

Example: New member joined chat 

    python chat.py 127.0.0.1 Alex
    Alex joined chat

> **Warning** <br>
> Don't use the same host for multiple members!    

### **Sending messages**

After connection to the server, you can easily communicate with all members in the chat

Example: Alex 'Hello, it's ME!'

    hh:mm:ss Alex: Hello, it's ME!

There you can see the time, when each member sent the message
